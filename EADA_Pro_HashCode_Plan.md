# EADA Pro: Enhanced Workspace Intelligence
## HashCode 13.0 Hackathon Project Plan

## Project Overview

EADA Pro (Enhanced Adaptive Display Assistant) is an AI-powered workspace optimization system that uses computer vision, audio processing, and machine learning to create an intelligent, adaptive workspace environment. Our project aligns with multiple HashCode tracks, particularly focusing on **More Accessibility** and **More Privacy/Security**.

## Hackathon Track Alignment

### Primary Track: More Accessibility
EADA Pro directly addresses accessibility challenges by:
- Automatically adapting display settings based on user distance and environmental conditions
- Monitoring ergonomics and providing real-time posture correction
- Offering personalized workspace optimization for users with different needs
- Supporting users with visual or auditory impairments through adaptive interfaces

### Secondary Track: More Privacy/Security
We enhance privacy and security by:
- Processing all sensitive data locally without cloud dependencies
- Implementing privacy-focused computer vision that doesn't store personal images
- Adding user presence detection for automatic screen privacy
- Developing secure user profiles with encrypted preferences
