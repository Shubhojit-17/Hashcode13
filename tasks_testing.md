# EADA Pro – Comprehensive Validation & Verification Plan

## 0. Testing Charter
- [ ] **Objective**: Guarantee that every deliverable in `tasks.md` functions as intended, meets hackathon judging criteria, and upholds accessibility, privacy, and performance promises.
- [ ] **Scope**: Covers perception, intelligence, adaptation, accessibility, security, analytics, deployment, business collateral, and demo readiness.
- [ ] **Test Philosophy**: Mix of automated regression where feasible, manual exploratory passes for UX/accessibility, and scenario-driven validation tied to personas.

## 1. Governance & Tooling
- [ ] **Test Owners**: Assign per squad (ML Engineer for model metrics, Full-Stack for API/UI, Tech Lead for integration, Product/Privacy for compliance).
- [ ] **Infrastructure**: pytest, unittest, Playwright, locust, bandit, safety, axe-core, NVDA, Wireshark, mitmproxy, Postman collections, GitHub Actions runners.
- [ ] **Artifacts**: Maintain `tests/` directory, `tests/README.md`, `tests/data/` for fixtures, `tests/reports/` for exports, and Notion QA board for tracking.
- [ ] **Entry/Exit Criteria**: No critical bugs open, ≥95% high-priority tests passing, known issues documented with mitigations.

## 2. Mission Snapshot Validation
- [ ] **Feature Parity Checklist**: Confirm adaptive brightness/volume, ergonomic alerts, accessibility controls, analytics dashboard, secure identity layer all demo-ready.
- [ ] **Live Demo Drill**: Rehearse full mission narrative end-to-end twice; capture video proof.
- [ ] **Collateral Review**: Product/Privacy strategist signs off on business, ethical, and privacy claims; cross-reference with implementation evidence.

## 3. Schedule Readiness Tests
- [ ] **Timeboxing Simulation**: Dry run key sprints in 2-hour windows to ensure tasks fit schedule.
- [ ] **Contingency Drills**: Simulate 30-minute network outage, hardware swap, or team member absence and log recovery playbook.

### 4.2 Intelligence Layer
- [ ] **Distance Estimation**: Compare predicted distance vs. ground truth markers at 0.5 m increments (0.25–4 m); tolerance ±10 cm.
- [ ] **Posture Analytics**: Validate neck/shoulder angles using motion capture reference or recorded calibration poses.
- [ ] **Blink Detector**: Run eye-blink dataset (BlinkingEyes2011 or custom) to ensure ≥97% accuracy; test false positives with head turns.
- [ ] **Eye-Strain Predictor**: Cross-validation on synthetic dataset; target F1 score ≥0.85.
- [ ] **Recommendation Engine**: Scenario-based tests verifying rule + ML arbitration, cooldown enforcement, explanation strings present.

### 4.3 Adaptation Layer
- [ ] **Brightness/Volume**: Mock `sbc` and `pycaw` drivers to assert correct scalar values; run manual validation on Windows host with lux meter and decibel app.
- [ ] **VLC Control**: Automation script verifying pause/resume triggers on face absence/presence within 3 s.
- [ ] **Notification UX**: Playwright tests checking overlay rendering, iconography, keyboard focus order.

### 4.4 Accessibility & Personas
- [ ] **Profile Storage**: Cryptographic tests ensuring AES-256-GCM encryption/decryption with tamper detection.
- [ ] **Voice Commands**: Evaluate whisper pipeline accuracy across accents; target ≥90% intent recognition.
- [ ] **Gestures**: Record gesture video set; verify classification latency <200 ms and precision ≥0.9.
- [ ] **Haptic Feedback**: Simulated BLE device acknowledgments; ensure no dropped alerts.
- [ ] **Persona Scenarios**: Scripted walkthrough for each persona (Accessibility Analyst, Hybrid Worker, Safety Officer, Visually Impaired) with success metrics.

## 5. Privacy & Security Validation
- [ ] **Blockchain Ledger**: Hardhat tests for smart contract functions, ensuring permission checks and event emissions.
- [ ] **ACA-Py Credentials**: End-to-end issuance, storage, presentation, and revocation flows using test DIDs.
- [ ] **DIDComm Channels**: Validate encryption, replay protection, and key rotation (ECDH handshake, AES-256-GCM sessions).
- [ ] **Data Lifecycle**: Memory profiling to confirm no frame buffers persist beyond processing window; run `objgraph` or `tracemalloc` for leak detection.
- [ ] **Threat Modeling**: STRIDE exercise; document mitigations and residual risks.
- [ ] **Pen Tests**: mitmproxy and Wireshark to detect plaintext leaks; run `bandit`, `safety`, `pip-audit` for dependencies; OWASP ZAP on REST endpoints.

## 6. API & Dashboard Testing
- [ ] **Contract Tests**: Schemathesis against OpenAPI spec to fuzz edge cases.
- [ ] **Functional UI Tests**: Playwright flows for live metrics, history filters, alerts acknowledgment, profile edits.
- [ ] **WebSocket Reliability**: Chaos tests dropping packets, delaying frames to ensure UI falls back gracefully.
- [ ] **Accessibility Audits**: axe-core + manual NVDA/VoiceOver walkthrough validating WCAG AA/AAA compliance.
- [ ] **Offline Mode**: Simulate network loss; confirm IndexedDB caches historical data and resyncs on reconnect.
- [ ] **Export Validation**: Assert CSV/PDF outputs contain accurate metrics, timestamps, and branding.

## 7. Performance & Scalability
- [ ] **Inference Benchmarks**: Measure FPS on reference hardware (with/without GPU) using `cProfile`; ensure ≥25 FPS.
- [ ] **Audio Latency**: Record end-to-end command recognition time (<150 ms) using timestamped logs.
- [ ] **API Load**: Locust scenario with 50 concurrent connections hitting `/metrics/live` and `/alerts`; monitor CPU/memory.
- [ ] **Cross-Device Sync**: Multi-device simulation sending simultaneous diffs; assert eventual consistency and conflict resolution.
- [ ] **Battery/Resource Monitoring**: Windows Performance Recorder or Intel VTune to profile CPU/GPU/power impact.

## 8. Data & Model Governance Tests
- [ ] **Dataset Audits**: Verify licensing metadata, anonymization, and diversity coverage per demographic.
- [ ] **Model Registry**: Unit test for registry CRUD operations; ensure rollback capability.
- [ ] **Bias Audits**: Evaluate false positive/negative rates across demographic slices; document fairness metrics.
- [ ] **Explainability Outputs**: Automated SHAP report generation for key recommendations; confirm interpretability captions appear in UI.

## 9. Deployment & Packaging Verification
- [ ] **Setup Scripts**: Run `setup_env`, `start_services`, `run_tests` on clean VM; ensure zero manual steps required.
- [ ] **Docker Images**: Build Besu and ACA-Py containers; perform smoke tests on local network.
- [ ] **Installer Footprint**: Measure download size; keep under hackathon bandwidth constraints.
- [ ] **Fallback Switches**: Toggle blockchain off and confirm application degrades gracefully with mock services.
- [ ] **Disaster Recovery**: Backup/restore config files, credentials, and analytics database snapshots.

## 10. Business & Presentation Validation
- [ ] **ROI Model Testing**: Spreadsheet formulas with unit tests (e.g., using `pytestsheets` or manual cross-check) to ensure calculations consistent.
- [ ] **Pricing Scenarios**: Validate tier pricing vs. cost assumptions; run sensitivity analysis.
- [ ] **Pitch Deck QA**: Review slides for technical accuracy, ensure diagrams match architecture.

- [ ] **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub Projects or Notion board with severity labels, SLA for fixes.
- [ ] **Daily QA Stand-up**: Quick syncs to review failures and assign owners.
- [ ] **Evidence Repository**: Store screenshots, recordings, logs, and reports for submission.
- [ ] **Retrospective**: Post-event session capturing lessons, automation gaps, and roadmap for long-term QA.
